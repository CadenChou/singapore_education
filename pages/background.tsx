            Singapore, officially known as the Republic of Singapore, is an
            island city-state located in Southeast Asia, bordering the southern
            tip of Malaysia. Its population of nearly six million is
            multi-ethnic and multi-religious, and is one of the wealthiest in
            the world. Singapore has four official languages: English, Malay,
            Mandarin, and Tamil.
          </p>
          <p>
            Singapore's contemporary era began when a British colonial official
            named Stamford Raffles established Singapore as a trading post for
            the British Empire in 1819. In 1963, Singapore declared independence
            from Malaysia and became a part of Malaysia. Today, Singapore is
            known for being an important business and financial hub for
            Southeast Asia and the world. The image carousel features a few
            popular landmarks.

              In Singapore, primary education lasts for six years, followed by
              secondary school which lasts four to five years, and finally post
              secondary school which is two to three years long. After secondary
              school, students have multiple postsecondary options including
              Polytechnic schools, the Institute of Technical Education (ITE),
              Junior Colleges, and other specialized institutions.

            <p className="text-lg text-text_white">
              Unlike most public high schools in the US, admission into
              secondary schools is dependent on oneâ€™s performance on the Primary
              School Leaving Examination (PSLE). The PSLE also determines which
              stream/track students can join: Express, Normal (Academic), or
              Normal (Technical). In Secondary school, students take
              subject-based O-level, N-level, and A-level exams depending on
              their track and year of study.

            <p className="text-lg text-text_white">
              Singapore has consistenly been one of the highest performing
              countries in terms of standardized testing. For example, Singapore
              was ranked #1 in mathematics, science, and reading in the
              Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) 2022. While
              the OECD average for the PISA Reading, Math, and Science sections
              were 476, 472, and 485 respectively, Singapore's scores were 543,
              575, and 561. Evidently, Singapore's education system is adept at
              producing successful learning outcomes in terms of assessment
              achievement. However, this prompts the question of whether this
              academic success comes at non-academic costs.
